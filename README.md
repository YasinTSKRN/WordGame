# WordGame
Basic WordGame example
Animation is not added under the time limit issue, as I have mentioned my SwiftUI knowlegde is not great right now, so if I started working on it, it was gonna take a lot of time.
Quit application function is also not applied because quitting your application or sending it to the background programmatically is a violation of the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines][1], which usually doesn't bode well for getting through the review process.
